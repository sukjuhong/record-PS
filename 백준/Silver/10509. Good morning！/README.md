### 문제 설명

<p>Good morning! This is your 5am wake-up call! A partly cloudy day is expected with light rain coming afternoon...</p>

<p>You have just woken up. You desperately need coffee... and... more coffee... and some cereal. And your clothes. And coffee.</p>

<p>To prepare warm cereal, you put some milk into a microwave, trying to heat it for k seconds. You must enter k on the microwave keyboard:</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" src="https://www.acmicpc.net/upload/images2/goodmorning.png"></p>

<p>As you still haven’t had your coffee, your hand (along with eyes and brain) keeps falling down. You are only able to enter a number if your hand would only move downwards and/or to the right. You cannot go back left, nor move your hand up, though you can press the same key again. And again... and again...</p>

<p>For example, you can enter the number 180 or 49, but not 98 or 132. Enter a number that is as close to k as possible. If there are two solutions, enter any one of them. You are too sleepy to actually care. And you need coffee.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains the number of test cases T. The descriptions of the test cases follow:</p>

<p>Each test case consists of one line containing an integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 200).</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, output a number that is closest to k which can be entered on the keyboard</p>
